Mix all together in large bowl: 

+ 3 cups rolled oats 
+ 2 cups mixed nuts (unsalted cashews, sliced almonds, walnut pieces, sunflower seeds) 
+ 3/4 C of unsweetened shredded coconut 

in a separate small bowl, stir up with a fork. 

+ 1/4 C sesame oil

Combine with the oat mixture, mix together until blended. Spread on two cookie sheets, bake at 250 F for 1 hour and 15 minutes stirring occasionally for even browning.
