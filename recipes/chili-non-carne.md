An incredibly great vegan chili based on a recipe from Cook's Illustrated (not linking to it because it's behind a stupid paywall). Feel free to experiment with the kinds of chile powder that you use, and make sure to use at least 2 different kinds. A lot of the flavor of dishes like this comes from the layers of chile flavor. 

Chop 

+ 10-15 brown mushrooms 
+ 1 onion 

and saute with a pinch of salt in olive oil in the bottom of large pot until nicely browned. 

Combine 

+ 1 T chili powder 
+ 1 T cumin 
+ 1 T ancho or New Mexico chile powder 
+ 1 T oregano 
+ 1/2 oz dried shiitake mushrooms, ground up into a powder 
+ 1 tsp chipotle chile powder 

and fry for the last minute or so. Add 

+ 7 cups (1.65 L) water 
+ brined beans 

and simmer gently for about 45 minutes (until the beans are tender). While the beans are simmering, use a rolling pin to smash 

+ 50 g walnuts 

inside zip top bag by rolling a rolling pin. Add to the zip top once the walnuts are smashed 

+ 3 T tomato paste 
+ 28 g diced tomatoes (1 big tin) 
+ 3 TB soy sauce 
+ 2 jalapeño chiles, chopped 
+ 6 garlic cloves, minced
+ 2/3 cup medium-grind bulgur 

and mix all together, and add to the pot. Cook for another 45 minutes or so at a gentle simmer until the flavors marry. After you turn off the heat, give it a good vigorous stir and let sit for 20 minutes to develop the starch (this step seems silly, but really helpful for texture). Way better the next day. 

## Braddock interpretation 

Double the jalapeños (use 4-5) and chili powder (up to your taste)
