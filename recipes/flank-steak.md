# Flank steak 

Season a 

+ 1-2 lb. **flank steak**

with 

+ **salt**
+ **black pepper**
+ **garlic powder** 

and set aside. Over medium-high heat, heat a cast iron pan. Once the pan is hot, add 

+ **splash of olive oil** 

and lay the steak away from you. The meat should sizzle immediately. Cook over medium-high heat until one side is nicely browned. Flip, and cook till the other side is nicely browned. 

Check for doneness by feeling the steak and remove from heat when at desired doneness. Remove from heat to a plate to let rest for 10 minutes. 

Slice thin perpendicular to the "grain" and serve hot or cold with the resting juices. (Prepared steak is also great in sandwiches, tacos, and on salad.)
